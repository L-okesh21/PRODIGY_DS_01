Task 1: Data Visualization - Population Dataset
📌 Objective
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the total population across different countries using data from the World Bank.

🌐 Dataset
Source: World Bank - Total Population Dataset

Format: CSV or Excel

Variable used: Total population of countries over selected years.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Steps Performed
Data Collection:

Downloaded population data from the World Bank.

Data Cleaning:

Removed missing values.

Selected the latest year with complete data.

Filtered out irrelevant columns.

Data Visualization:

Created a bar chart showing the population of the top 10 most populous countries.

Custom styling with labels, title, grid, and colors for better readability.

📊 Insights Gained
Identified top populous countries.

Observed how population is distributed across countries.

Gained hands-on experience in transforming real-world data into visual formats.

📁 Output Example

(Include the actual plot image if possible)

💡 Learning Outcomes
Improved skills in working with public datasets.

Understood how to clean and prepare data for visualization.

Learned how to use Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective storytelling with data.

📊 Task 1: Visualizing Population Distribution
📝 Objective
The goal of this task is to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable — in this case, the total population across different countries — using publicly available data.

🌐 Dataset
Source: World Bank - Total Population

Type: Time-series dataset showing population data for countries over the years

Format: CSV/Excel (downloaded from World Bank)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

🔧 Steps Performed
Data Acquisition

Downloaded population data from the World Bank website.

Data Cleaning

Loaded data using pandas.

Selected relevant columns (country names and latest year population).

Removed rows with missing or zero population values.

Visualization

Created a bar chart showing the top 10 countries by population.

Customized plot with:

Country labels on the x-axis

Population counts on the y-axis

Title, color scheme, and value annotations

📈 Sample Output
(You can insert the image or screenshot of your bar chart here)

🔍 Insights
Countries like China and India dominate global population figures.

The visual clearly shows the gap between top populous countries and the rest.

Simple visualizations can effectively convey powerful demographic data.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Understood the process of importing and cleaning real-world data.

Practiced generating bar charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Gained skills in visual storytelling and interpreting distribution patterns in population data.
